Feel free to enjoy.

Issues: 
Invisible main "host window" of keyboard ui element dimensions need bringing back in. possibly a rogue scintilla control i see spawning from the custom element.

Optionally temporarily replace some mousefeedback lines with usefull macro fucntions such as measuring cursor drag-rect.
